            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Drushtivishwa is an inclusive education and support initiative by Dnyansangam Foundation, dedicated to empowering visually impaired students and fostering an inclusive society.

These obstacles often lead to limited academic and professional opportunities, affecting their confidence and future prospects.</p>

The initiative not only helps visually impaired students successfully complete their education but also works toward changing societal perceptions and promoting a culture of inclusivity and equal opportunities.</p>
