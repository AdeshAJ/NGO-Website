            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Mental well-being is just as important as physical health, yet it remains one of the most overlooked aspects of education and personal development, especially in underprivileged communities. Many children, mentors, and even community members face emotional struggles, stress, and anxiety, but they lack access to psychological support and guidance. Recognizing this urgent need, Dnyansangam Foundation launched Santulan, a mental health initiative dedicated to promoting emotional balance and well-being among students, mentors, and community members.</p>
            <p>Santulan, meaning "Balance," aims to create a safe and supportive environment where individuals can express themselves, overcome emotional challenges, and build resilience. The program offers counseling, stress management workshops, emotional intelligence training, and awareness campaigns to ensure that mental health is prioritized and addressed effectively.</p>
