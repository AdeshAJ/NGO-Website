        <h1>History of Dnyansangam Foundation</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The formal establishment of Dnyansangam Foundation took place on <span class="highlight">September 11, 2022</span>, at the prestigious <span class="highlight">Fergusson College, Pune</span>. The idea of this foundation was conceived and realized by students from Fergusson and Modern College. Inspired by the goal of making a difference in the field of education, the foundation was founded.</p>

        <p>While discussing the objectives of the foundation, several crucial issues related to primary education emerged. It was observed that the number of students in Pune Municipal Corporation schools was declining. Particularly, children of parents residing in slum areas were attending these schools. However, a significant dropout rate was noticed. For example, if 50 students enrolled in 1st grade, only about 10 students remained by the time they reached 7th grade. Research was conducted to find solutions to this problem, leading to the following conclusions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Parents lack awareness about education, leading to negligence towards their children's schooling.</li>
            <li>Many children fall into addiction from grades 3rd and 4th onwards.</li>
            <li>Some students eventually turn towards criminal activities, which leads to dropping out of school.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Considering these observations, the foundation decided to adopt a school and work towards the holistic development of its students. Thus, the <span class="highlight">"Anusaya Bai Khilare School, Erandwane, Pune"</span> was adopted. College students were appointed as mentors, and teaching sessions for 8th, 9th, and 10th-grade students were started. The initiative started enthusiastically for the first two weeks and proved beneficial for students. However, as college exams began, the school activities became disorganized.</p>

        <p>As a solution, the foundation decided to set up educational centers within slums to ensure continuity.</p>

        <h2>The First Educational Center</h2>
        <p>The foundation's first educational center was established at <span class="highlight">Chhatrapati Shivajinagarâ€™s Shirole Slum, Dattawadi Colony</span>. Permission to conduct classes was obtained at the <span class="highlight">Datt Mandir Temple</span>, with invaluable support from <span class="highlight">Balasaheb Bodke Dada</span> and <span class="highlight">Datta Sir</span>. The foundation celebrated its first official working day on <span class="highlight">February 6, 2024</span>, with 10 students and 10 coordinators in attendance. In the following period, <span class="highlight">Ansh Jaiswal</span> and <span class="highlight">Saanika</span> took responsibility for managing the center efficiently. On the first day, 10 students participated, and within a year, the number increased to 50 students.</p>

        <p>Special tests, career guidance, psychological counseling, and social values education were introduced for 8th and 9th-grade students. Additionally, a <span class="highlight">"Book Club"</span> was started to encourage reading habits among students.</p>

        <h2>Psychology and Disability Assistance Division</h2>
        <p>As the foundation expanded, it became evident that students required psychological support. Issues such as anger management, emotional struggles, and family relationship difficulties were common. To address these problems, a meeting was held with Vice-Chancellor <span class="highlight">Gosavi Sir</span> of Savitribai Phule Pune University, who was informed about the situation. As a result, the university's psychology department conducted a one-month free psychological counseling program for Dnyansangam Foundation students, which significantly improved their mental health.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, another major issue was identified: blind students in colleges faced difficulties in obtaining writers for exams and study materials. To resolve this, the <span class="highlight">"Drushtivishwa"</span> (Vision World) initiative was launched, providing writers and educational assistance to visually impaired students. However, the foundation members decided not to limit their efforts to just assistance but to change society's perception towards the visually impaired and create more opportunities for them.</p>

        <h2>Ongoing Projects at the Foundation</h2>

        <h3>Prayas (Effort):</h3>
        <p>Providing education and essential learning resources to children is the primary focus of this initiative. It includes basic literacy, digital education, and moral education. The foundation also focuses on teacher guidance, student attendance, and educational quality. Alongside academics, activities are conducted to enhance personality development, decision-making skills, and self-confidence.</p>

        <h3>Trekking for Mental and Physical Well-being:</h3>
        <p>Effective education is only possible when students are physically and mentally healthy. Therefore, activities such as trekking, yoga, meditation, and outdoor games are included. A trekking event is organized every month to promote students' mental and physical well-being.</p>

        <h3>Drushtivishwa (Vision World):</h3>
        <p>Special education facilities, assistive tools, and inclusive education policies have been introduced for disabled children. The foundation organizes exclusive programs, skill training, job opportunities, and awareness campaigns to promote their acceptance in society. Competitions, events, and awareness drives are conducted to highlight the potential of disabled students.</p>

        <h3>Katha-Kala (Storytelling & Arts):</h3>
        <p>To nurture children's creativity, opportunities are provided in storytelling, poetry recitation, art, music, theater, dance, and literature. A cultural event is conducted every month to help children gain confidence and stage presence.</p>

        <h2>Current Impact and Future Plans</h2>
        <p>At present, the foundation has over <span class="highlight">500 members</span> (educators) and more than <span class="highlight">100 students</span>.</p>

        <p>In the future, the foundation plans to expand its psychological support division and enhance its existing educational centers to help more students.</p>

        <p>Dnyansangam Foundation is actively working in the fields of education, mental health, and disability assistance, serving as a ray of hope for underprivileged communities. The foundation aims to broaden its reach and impact even further in the future.</p>
