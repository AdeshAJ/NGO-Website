            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Kaathiki is an initiative by Dnyansangam Foundation that aims to discover, nurture, and celebrate storytelling and artistic expression. Many students and young individuals, especially from underprivileged backgrounds, have immense creative potential but lack opportunities to explore fields like storytelling, poetry, music, theater, dance, and literature. Due to financial and social barriers, their talents often go unnoticed, leaving them without a platform to express themselves.</p>
            <p>Kaathiki provides that missing stage, offering a safe space for self-expression through storytelling circles, open mic events, cultural performances, and creative workshops. Through monthly events, mentorship programs, and training sessions, this initiative empowers individuals to find their voice, share their narratives, and belong to the world of stories.</p>
